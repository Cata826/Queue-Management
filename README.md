# Queue Management Application

## Overview
This application is designed to efficiently manage queues by assigning customers in a way that minimizes waiting time. It utilizes advanced queuing algorithms to ensure optimal allocation of customers to queues, reducing the overall waiting period.

## Key Features
- **Secure Authentication**: Robust authentication system that includes email verification for secure and authentic accounts.
- **Queue Management Algorithms**: Implements advanced scheduling algorithms to efficiently distribute customers across available queues based on the minimum waiting time.
- **GUI**: Graphical User Interface allows users to input simulation parameters and view results interactively.
- **Random Customer Generation**: Generates random customers to be assigned to queues during simulations.
- **Testing and Documentation**: Comprehensive unit tests and detailed documentation of code and GUI functionalities.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: Primary programming language for backend development.
- **Swing for GUI**: Used to create interactive user interfaces.
- **Multithreading**: Utilizes multiple threads to manage queues and handle customer assignments simultaneously.
- **ExecutorService**: Manages a pool of threads to execute queue processing.
